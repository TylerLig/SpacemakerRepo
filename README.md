## Running the project

You will need the [dotnet runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to run the applciation server.

If you don't wish to download the runtime, I've put self-contained executables for both win-x64 and os-x64 in the [bin/Release/](bin/Release/) directory as well, they just have much larger file sizes.
\
\
\
If you have the runtime, within the [bin/Release/portable/](bin/Release/portable/) directory you can run:

### `dotnet spacemaker.dll`

This will run the app server.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

Changes to the proposed solutions are not persistent, you can just refresh the page to reset them.
